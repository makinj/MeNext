*A Music Request Service with a Hint of Democracy*

Have you ever been to a social gathering and wanted to share cool music with the group without taking over the music entirely? With MeNext, this is possible! MeNext enables users to submit their own suggestions to a playlist at a party. Other party-goers can then vote to decide what gets played and when.

#Setup

1. Download the MeNext files and place them in a server location.
2. Make sure that MySQL, PHP, and cURL are properly installed and configured on the server.
3. Copy /includes/constants.template.php to a file named /includes/constants.php and fill in the correct values for your database default admin account and API keys.
4. If you find any problems or bugs, or if you have any questions, please feel free to open up a GitHub Issue!
